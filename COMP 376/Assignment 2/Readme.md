The Asset files are split between the different folders depending on their uses and they have self-explanatory names.

To run the game on the Unity Engine, open the "GameScene" Scene and press play. The game handles the logic of going between the "GameScene" which houses the gameplay and the "GameOver" Scene which houses the player's final score and a button to restart the game.
