COMP 425 Winter 2022
- Assignment 1 by Anik Patel 40091908

How to run:
- Install all the pip requirement using the requirements.txt file
- Run the program by running a1.py

The program will by default run all parts of the assignment one after the other.
Using OpenCV, it displays all the images in an OpenCV window by default 
but can be changed to save the images as a file by changing the `Debug` variable
to `True` on line 13.

With the images displayed, pressing any key on the keyboard, it will go to the next image.
In the console, it will be displayed how long each function took to run.
I am using a downscaled version of the provided santorini image in order to make the run times
more reasonable.

All the requirements are done except for part 5B.
